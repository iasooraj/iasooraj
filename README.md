# About me

### Hey :wave:	

I'm Sooraj Nandakumar and I'm a junior in Aerospace Engineering. I'm a beginner at coding but love the idea of being able to program computers and utilizing them to automate intricate processes. In my free time I enjoy flying and building drones. I hope to learn how to code the microcontrollers that control these drones.
